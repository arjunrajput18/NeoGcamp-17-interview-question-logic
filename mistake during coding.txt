1)in news detect app 
eg newsArray=["x","y","z"];
var check=newsArray.includes(input); <-- correct method
learn: it automatically run it dont need to make for loop newsArray[i]  <-- wrong method;


2)when compare password or any dont forget .length funtion

3)if double equal sign
output.style.display="none"  <-single equal .. not ==

4)during copy paste above method please see double equal and single equal .see everything is fine or not

5)alway check array[i] before using in anything

6)remember always div element we can add style property not on txtInput.value here we can apply on only txtInput
